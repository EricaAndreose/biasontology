According to the definition provided on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúNormalcy bias, or‚ÄØnormality bias, is a‚ÄØcognitive bias‚ÄØwhich leads people to disbelieve or minimize threat warnings‚Äù. The bias is manifested in cases of incoming natural disasters or calamities caused by human error where it‚Äôs estimated that about 70% of the population tends to minimize threats and so to display this bias.

People‚Äôs behaviour tends to be believing the less alarming option when in danger and this belief remains still until confirmation from other sources or unambiguous instructions are given. This bias can lead to a lack of preparedness, inadequate response to warnings, and a false sense of security, ultimately resulting in serious consequences.

Abnormalcy bias and normalcy bias can often be noticed in conjunction when authorities decide not to say everything, they know about the danger both because they mistakenly think the threat is unlikely and believe that even if it does happen, people wouldn't be able to use the information to cope effectively (Omer 1994).

#### Can you give me a definition of "Normalcy Bias"?

The appeal to probability fallacy, also known as the argument from probability, occurs when someone argues that because something is likely to happen, it is therefore true or should be believed. This fallacy disregards evidence or logical reasoning and relies on the probability of an event occurring rather than on conclusive support. The mere likelihood of an outcome does not necessarily make it true, and conclusions drawn solely from probability without proper evidence can be misleading. In critical thinking and argumentation, it is essential to consider both the probability of an event and the available evidence to make a valid and well-supported conclusion.

#### Can you create 10 scenarios compelling with the bias?



#### Now consider the scenario "" and give me a short user story from it.



#### If you should make an ontology based of the "Normalcy Bias" which classes and properties would you create?
