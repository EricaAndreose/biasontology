The Illusion of External Agency is a cognitive bias where individuals mistakenly attribute their self-generated satisfaction to an external, influential, insightful and benevolent agent.
This bias consists of illusions of influence, insight, and benevolence.For instance, when people underestimate their capacity to generate satisfaction with future outcomes and experience such self-generated satisfaction, they may conclude that it was caused by an external agent1. This bias can also lead to the false belief that positive outcomes occur due to external influences rather than personal effort.This cognitive bias suggests that belief in omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent external agents, such as God, may derive in part from peopleâ€™s failure to recognize that they have generated their own satisfaction.

#### Can you give me a definition of "Illusion of external agency" bias?

The illusion of external agency, as a cognitive bias, refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive external forces, beings, or entities as having intentional and purposeful actions, even when none exist. This bias involves attributing human-like qualities, motivations, or consciousness to external stimuli, inanimate objects, or abstract concepts. People experiencing this illusion may believe that events or occurrences are guided by some form of intentional agency, often overlooking more plausible explanations rooted in natural or non-conscious processes. This cognitive bias can lead to the ascription of meaning, purpose, or deliberate action to phenomena that are, in reality, devoid of intentional agency.  

#### Ok now give me 10 example scenarios of illusion of external agency bias 

Certainly! Here are ten example scenarios illustrating the illusion of external agency bias: 

    Finding a Lucky Charm: Believing that carrying a specific item, like a lucky charm or a particular piece of clothing, directly influences positive outcomes in various life situations. 

    Sports Superstitions: Athletes who think that certain rituals or habits, unrelated to their performance, contribute to their success, such as wearing specific socks or following a particular routine before a game. 

    Traffic Light Persuasion: Feeling that one's thoughts or wishes can influence traffic lights to turn green more quickly if a person concentrates hard enough. 

    Electronic Device Preferences: Thinking that a computer or smartphone works better when treated with care, gratitude, or even scolding it when it malfunctions, ascribing intentional behavior to the device. 

    Weather Rituals: Engaging in rituals or behaviors, like wearing a specific outfit or performing a particular dance, to influence weather conditions or bring about a desired climate change. 

    Gambling Superstitions: Believing that certain actions, like blowing on dice, can affect the outcome of a game of chance, attributing intentionality to random events. 

    Finding Patterns in Random Events: Seeing intentional patterns or messages in random occurrences, such as interpreting coincidences as signs from a higher power or external force. 

    Relationship Rituals: Thinking that performing specific actions, like following a set routine or adhering to certain relationship rules, can influence the success or stability of a romantic partnership. 

    Animistic Beliefs: Attributing consciousness or intentional agency to natural elements, such as believing that trees or rocks have feelings, thoughts, or motivations. 

    Technological Animism: Believing that electronic devices, like a malfunctioning computer or a glitchy software program, have a personal vendetta or intention to cause inconvenience, rather than recognizing technical issues. 


#### Now consider the scenario "7. Finding Patterns in Random events" and give me a small user story from it 

\*\*Scenario:\*\*

Samantha, a superstitious individual, often finds herself searching for patterns in seemingly random events. One day, she notices that every time she wears her favorite blue sweater, she receives positive news or experiences good events. Convinced that her sweater holds a special charm, Samantha starts wearing it during important meetings, exams, and social events, believing that the positive outcomes are directly linked to the garment. Despite the events being unrelated to the color of her sweater, Samantha maintains a strong conviction in the illusion of external agency, attributing her successes to the mystical powers she associates with the clothing item.
